This is a custom cross-platform game engine created in C++ and OpenGL.

I approached this project as an opportunity to learn OpenGL (of which I had previously been unfamiliar) and to sharpen my C++ skills.

This project was coded alongside this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pid8JGlBdPY&index=5&list=PLlrATfBNZ98fqE45g3jZA_hLGUrD4bo6_) which provided the ideation and code walkthrough for this project.

I intend to use the tutorial as a starting point to teach me the requisit skills, then branch off and add my own functionality. I will update this README file with a list of the original content I added once I reach this stage.
